        A merger is a class that allows for a number of images to merged sequentially. It is designed to
        merge each image incrementally, outputting to an outfile when requested. There are a variety of
        ways to preform the merges for different circumstance. The class contains an autosave feature that
        will save the image after each merge, which is defaulted to off. There is also a contained PixelChecker
        and PixelActor, which define how the merges process.
        Merger works off an internal state. Each merge operation (irrelevant of number merged in that operation)
        changes the state of the output data. Merge and MergeAs change the state permanently. ExportMerge and
        TestMerge do not change the state of the output data.
